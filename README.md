EUGCOMM: A database of euglossine bee communities

EUGCOMM is a database of euglossine bee assemblages collected at fragrance baits. It is meant to be continuously updated as new data become available. We welcome suggestions for datasets to be added and errors to be corrected, preferably by posting in the 'Issues' list for this GitHub repository.

The database is available as an Excel file (in the Database folder), and as an R list object (in the Database/R files folder). The R Code folder includes the necessary code for building the list object from the raw data, and to extract data from the list object.

The database is described in Opedal, Ã˜.H., Martins, A.A. & Marjakangas, E-L. 2020. A database and synthesis of euglossine bee assemblages collected at fragrance baits. Apidologie: doi: 10.1007/s13592-020-00739-4. The accepted manuscript in available in the 'Manuscript' folder.
